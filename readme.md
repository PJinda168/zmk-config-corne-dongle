# ZMK Corne Keyboard Layout

This this my personal [zmk](https://github.com/zmkfirmware/zmk) config for my [corne keyboard](https://github.com/foostan/crkbd), the firmware is built to work with the following devices.

- Keyboard: Corne 6 column
- Controller: nice!nano v2 + 4 pin oled (for both left and right keyboard)
- Dongle: Propspector Seed Xiao nRF52840 controller

> This is a dongle setup with zmk studio support. Left and Right keyboard both acts as peripheral and seed xiao as the main controller. This increases the battery life of the left board compared to when it is used as both main and left peripheral.
